  "description": "Modern web applications are becoming increasingly complex, with frontends directly interacting with multiple backend services becoming the norm. Traditional server-side load balancing cannot solve the multi-service routing problem on the browser side. Smart Load Balancer was born to solve this problem, providing lightweight, intelligent browser-side load balancing capabilities.",
